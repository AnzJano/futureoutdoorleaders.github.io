        <h1>Our Mission</h1>

        <p class="lead">
          At Future Outdoor Leaders, we're helping young people reconnect with something increasingly rare: time outdoors,
          away from screens, and fully engaged with the world around them.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Our activities give the youth hands-on experiences and the space needed to build real world skills, resilience,
          and a sense of responsibility to each other and the environment.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          We are dedicated to introducing kids to the outdoors, teaching them the value of conservation, building a community,
          and giving real-world experiences away from screens.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Tournament</h2>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            One of our signature programs, the Youth Fishing Tournament, brings kids together to learn patience teamwork, conservation, and confidence.
            Each year, we equip young anglers with the essentials they need to begin their outdoor journey.
            Participants have received sleeping bags, fishing poles, tackle boxes, tents, flashlights,
            and other gear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside providing essentials, we make it a priority to educate participants about the Department of Natural Resources
            and the importance of following state fishing rules and regulations. We instill the ethical and legal practices of the DNR,
            including minimum size, daily limits, life preserver safety, and maintaining fish in a healthy condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            By providing both hands-on learning and the tools to continue fishing long after the tournament ends, we're investing
            in a lifelong love of the outdoors and building a community rooted in respect for nature, adventure, and shared tradition.
