        <h1>Our Mission</h1>

        <p class="lead">
          Our Youth Fishing Tournament is built on the belief that every child deserves a chance to explore,
          respect, and be knowledgeable about our environment.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The Youth Fishing Tournament brings kids together to learn patience, teamwork, and confidence without phones,
          tablets, or constant digital noise.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Our activities give the youth hands-on experiences and the space needed to build real world skills, resilience,
          and a sense of responsibility to each other and the environment.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          We are dedicated to introducing kids to the outdoors, teaching them the value of conservation, building a community,
          and giving real-world experiences away from screens.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Tournament</h2>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Each year, we equip young anglers with the essentials they need to begin their outdoor journey.
            Last year alone, participants received sleeping bags, fishing poles, tackle boxes, tents, flashlights,
            and other gear from Bass Pro and a total of over $4,800.00.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside providing essentials, we make it a priority to educate participants about the Department of Natural Resources
            and the importance of following state fishing rules and regulations. We instill the ethical and legal practices of the DNR,
            including minimum size, daily limits, life preserver safety, and maintaining fish in a healthy condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            By providing both hands-on learning and the tools to continue fishing long after the tournament ends, we're investing
            in a lifelong love of the outdoors and building a community rooted in respect for nature, adventure, and shared tradition.
